# EDA and Initial Modeling for Stock Returns

This project aims to explore and model a stock returns dataset by conducting structured **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and setting up a baseline modeling pipeline. It includes return-based feature engineering, missing value treatment, and both intraday and interday data analysis.

## Objective

To enhance understanding of market return behavior by:

- Analyzing and visualizing `Ret_*`, `Feature_*`, and `Weight_*` columns
- Handling missing data for more reliable downstream modeling
- Identifying signal-rich features using correlation and autocorrelation
- Setting up initial train/test splits and model scaffolds (e.g., XGBoost, Linear Regression)

##  Planned Tasks

-  Study structure and composition of the raw dataset
-  Perform missing value analysis with `missingno`
-  Visualize return patterns, distributions, and weights
-  Define and extract feature and target sets
-  Apply ACF/PACF plots to analyze temporal dependencies

##  Status

- Project completed
